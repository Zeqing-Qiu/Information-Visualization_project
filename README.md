Report titleï¼šA Statistical Model for Frequency of Coastal Flooding in Honolulu, Hawaii, During the 21st Century

Introduction:In recent years, the frequency of small floods in many areas is increasing, and its cumulative impact may exceed rare extreme cases. Therefore, it is of great significance to verify whether the repeated small floods are related to the rising trend of sea level and to quantify the impact of sea level rise on the trend of flood events in the next few years. Our first visual chart shows the trend of sea level change in Honolulu over the years, and the second chart shows the days when the water level exceeds the limit over the years. We modified the visualization to make it more readable, and we listed the social impact the report could have.

Our reports are based on the following web pages: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JC014741
